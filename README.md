## Project Overview
This Hospital Emergency project aims is to analyze and provide insights in order to monitor patients traffic in the Hospital in the past year. By analyzing various aspects of Hospital Activities, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the Hospital performance.


### Data Sources

Hospital Emergency Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Hopital ER.csv" file, containing detailed information about each activities of the Hospital.


### Tools

- PowerBI - Creating/visualization of reports [view here](https://www.novypro.com/profile_projects/ibrahimadejumo)

### Data Cleaning Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1.Data loading and inspection.
2.Handling missing values.
3.Data cleaning and formatting.



### Key Performance Indicator Data Analysis:
KPI involved exploring the Hospital Emergency Room Data to answer key questions, such as:

1.Total no of people visiting the emergency room:

2. No of patients by gender

3. Average waiting time by month

4. Average patient satisfaction by month

5. No of Patients by Age in ER

6. No of patients by department referral

7. No of patients by race

8. No of patients by week day

9.No of patients by time



### Data Analysis report

1. The total no of patient who visited the hospital is 9,216, the Average age of patient visiting the hospital is 39.86 while the Average wait time of patient at the Hospital is 35.26 and the average satisfactory score is 4.99

2. The Number of Patient at the hospital has steadily increasing over the past year, with a alot of patient visiting the hospital more over the Weekend.

3. Morning shift has the highest number of people seeking medical care

4. The Old people and the white race visited the hospital more which further indicate that the male gender visited the hospital more often.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

1. More staffs is to be made available over the weekend and in the morning shifts 

2. The Hospital should focus more on why patient wait more before they are attended to 

3. The Hospital should improve on how to serve and satisfy the patient 



### Limitations

I had to replace values of the gender column, extract time and hour from date and time column and regroup patient age column using conditional column in power query because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.
